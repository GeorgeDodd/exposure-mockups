Here we provide a simple wrapper script which makes use of Python's built in HTTP server. To use this, you need to have:

* a working Python 3 installation
* the requests package

I think that is about it. It is then a simple ``python3 path/to/server.py`` to launch a HTTP server using the current folder as the server root and listening on port 8000. To test, go to `http://localhost:8000/ <http://localhost:8000/>`_
